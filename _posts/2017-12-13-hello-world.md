**Coding is the alphabet of 21st century. It is the way we think and we write. This weekend the historical city of Prizren hosted its very first hackathon CoderGals with the intention of gathering girls from around Kosovo to work on open source projects and to contribute for an open society.**

**CoderGals is the first hackathon of its kind and the only held in Prizren. I and my sister Qendresa with the intention of popularizing the computer programming organized the two day hackathon which gathered 26 girls from around Kosovo. Participants worked on groups of five contributing to existing open source projects and started projects from scratch. There was a variety of projects targeting mobile devices, web technologies, and online communication technologies.**
